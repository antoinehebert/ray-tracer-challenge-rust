# Introduction
Learning Rust by implementing a basic ray tracer, following the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/) by [Jamis Buck](https://github.com/jamis).

# Prerequisite

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

# Running tests

    cargo test

# Running app

    cargo run > putting_it_together.ppm && open putting_it_together.ppm

# TODOs
- Optimize! This is slooooooow.
- Save to file directly instead of outputting a String.
- Rename Tuple to Vector4 or something that makes more sense to me.
